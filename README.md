My first actual page app. Basically it is sheets and audio upload app.
It is still far from being complete.
I was trying out many ways of getting the code to work and didn't really clear it up.
Lots of unused functions, logs and not many comments.
I also was naming my properties in Polish.

It uses pdf-viewer to display sheets and nxg-audio-player to play the audio of the song.
Database and storage are utilizing Firebase.

Upload is handled by the cloud fire storage function in another file.
